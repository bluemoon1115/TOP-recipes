        <h1>The Farmer's Frittata (Italian-Style Omelet)</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            Loaded with fresh vegetables and a touch of bacon, 
            this farmer's frittata is my favorite type of frittata. <br>
            It's a perfect way to use your gorgeous, fresh garden vegetables. <br>
            Curing the squash with kosher salt pulls out the bitterness and makes the squash taste sweeter. <br>
            It's got great texture, taste, and visual appeal and can be served hot, warm, at room temperature or cold for any meal of the day.

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
            <li>2 ½ cups cubed zucchini</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups cubed yellow summer squash</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 slice thick-cut bacon, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch strips</li>
            <li>8 large eggs</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sliced green onions, or to taste</li>
            <li>⅓ cup diced red onion</li>
            <li>1 cup diced sweet peppers</li>
            <li>2 ounces grated sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Combine zucchini and summer squash in a bowl and sprinkle 2 tablespoons kosher salt over top; toss until everything is evenly coated. <br>
                Let sit for 15 minutes, tossing occasionally.</li>
            <li>Thoroughly rinse squash with cold water to remove all salt; transfer to a colander and let drain for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 10-inch, oven-proof skillet over medium heat. Add bacon and cook until browned and almost crisp, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the bacon is cooking, mix eggs, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, black pepper, cayenne, and green onions together with a fork in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Raise the heat on the bacon to medium-high; toss in peppers and red onion plus a pinch of salt. Cook and stir until the peppers just start to soften and the onions turn translucent, about 3 minutes. <br>
                    Add drained squash and carefully stir together; cook until squash is just barely tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Toss Cheddar cheese into the skillet and pour egg mixture over top. <br>
                    Stir with a spatula (like you were making scrambled eggs) until it starts to thicken up, 30 to 45 seconds. Shake the pan gently to settle the contents and turn off the heat. <br>
                    Push the edges down a bit with the spatula and sprinkle goat cheese over top. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
            <li>Place under the preheated broiler until the surface is lightly browned and frittata is firm to the touch, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with more green onions and let cool for 5 minutes before transferring it onto a serving plate.</li>
        </ol>
